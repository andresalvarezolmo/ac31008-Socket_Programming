comment on 4 items that are incomplete to recover some marks. 

single page 
for each chosen item the problem must be briefly explained (what is happening compared to the expected result) with 
appropriate references to the protocol and a possible solution (why this is happening and how it could be prevented). 

At least half of the issues must be related to network and the protocol, 
i.e. they should not be purely coding related.

The other half can be coding related (bugs, ... ) but should be put in perspective 
of networks and the protocol.

instead explain how you would extend your implementation to achieve additional features 
appropriate references to the protocol are expected and the comments
should focus more on the network viewpoint than coding.
